# Spark-Twitter-Watson-Dashboard
This sample Spark Streaming application collects Twitter data and run analytics in real-time that compute the top hashtags as well as a distribution of the emotional tones (provided by Watson Tone Analyzer). Then results show on a live dashboard web app featuring dynamic graphics that update continuously.

## Deploy to IBM Bluemix

The fastest way to deploy this application to Bluemix is to click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button below. If you prefer instead to deploy manually to Bluemix skip ahead to the next section.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://deployment-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/1cf78b25577e3e58e5c33589753beae8/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sultanshakir/Spark-Twitter-Watson-Dashboard)

**Don't have a Bluemix account?** If you haven't already, you'll be prompted to [sign up](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) for a Bluemix account when you click the button.  Sign up, verify your email address, then return here and click the the **Deploy to Bluemix** button again. Your new credentials let you deploy to the platform and also to code online with Bluemix and Git. If you have questions about working in Bluemix, find answers in the [Bluemix Docs](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/).

##Build and Deploy Locally

### Configure Cloud Foundry

If you haven't already:

1. [Install the Cloud Foundry command line interface.](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/install_cli.html)
2. Follow the instructions at the above link to connect to Bluemix.
3. Follow the instructions at the above link to log in to Bluemix.


###Build

_Note: This section is optional and only applies if you make changes to the application_
<p>To build the application, you need to use the <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp framework</a>. The build handles the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>Collect and copy various artifacts to the build area, like fonts, styles, and imgs.</li>
<li>Compile all the js and jsx files into a bundle that can also execute on the browser (uses <a href="http://browserify.org/" target="_blank">browserify</a>).</li>
<li>Minify the code and deploy it into the build area.</li>
</ol>

<p>To start the build manually, call <code>gulp build</code></p>

###Deploy

To deploy to Bluemix, simply:

    $ cf push

**Note:** You may notice that Bluemix assigns a URL to your application containing a random word. This is defined in the `manifest.yml` file where the `random-route` key set to the value of `true`. This ensures that multiple people deploying this application to Bluemix do not run into naming collisions. To specify your own route, remove the `random-route` line from the `manifest.yml` file and add a `host` key with the unique value you would like to use for the host name.


### Privacy Notice

This web application includes code to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker) service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

#### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing the following line from `server.js`:

```
require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();
```

Once that line is removed, you may also uninstall the `cf-deployment-tracker-client` npm package.
